So a pharmaceutical company's attempt to justify high prices because of the need to recoup R&D expenses is fallacious. The company will charge market prices whether R&D had cost one dollar or one million dollars. However, R&D costs, and the ability to recoup those costs, are a factor in deciding whether to spend the money on R&D. It's important to distinguish that while justifying high prices on past R&D is a fallacy, raising prices in order to finance future R&D is not. Counterpoint: It is sometimes not that simple. In a broad range of situations, it is rational for people to condition behavior on sunk costs, because of informational content, reputational concerns, or financial and time constraints.

Assigning responsibility to someone or something other than the victim allows the observer to believe that the mishap wasn\'t the victim\'s fault or that it wasn\'t just pure random chance; neither of which are psychologically palatable conclusions due to the similarity of observer and victim. The use of defensive attributions is considered a cognitive bias because an individual will change their beliefs about a situation based upon their psychological motives rather than the factual characteristics of the situation. Example: Often times, in this case of a woman who has not been raped hearing about the rape of another women, the very commonly heard responses are, "She must have been wearing provocative clothing," or "She was probably walking in a very sketchy part of town late at night". These attributions of causal factors to something other than the victim or random chance serve to shield the observer from acknowledging they could be a similar victim to a similar calamity.',

Driver A is driving down a road and in a moment of inattention runs a red light as a child is crossing the street. Driver A slams the brakes, swerves, and does everything to try to avoid hitting the child. Alas, the car hits and kills the child. Driver B in the meantime also runs a red light, but since no one is crossing, gets a traffic ticket but nothing more. If it is given that moral responsibility should only be relevant when the agent voluntarily performed or failed to perform some action, Drivers A and B should be blamed equally, or praised equally, as may be the case. However, due to the effect of Moral Luck, if a bystander were asked to morally evaluate Drivers A and B. there is very good reason to expect them to say that Driver A is due more moral blame than Driver B.',

      'The cognitive bias which causes people to think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group. This effect occurs with male-only, female-only and mixed gender groups and both small and large groups. The effect occurs to the same extent with groups of four and 16 people. Participants in studies looked\nmore at the attractive people than the unattractive people in the group. The effect does not occur because group photos give the impression that individuals have more social or emotional intelligence. This was shown to be the case by a study which used individual photos grouped together in a single image, rather than photos taken of people in a group. The study generated the same effect.',
